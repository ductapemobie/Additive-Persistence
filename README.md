# Additive Persistence

### Definitions
Definitions taken directly from Weekly Coding Challenge
- The additive persistence of an integer, n, is the number of times you have to replace n with the sum of its digits until n becomes a single digit integer.
- The multiplicative persistence of an integer, n, is the number of times you have to replace n with the product of its digits until n becomes a single digit integer.

### Solution
- The both defined functions are stored in index.js, along with 6 test cases
